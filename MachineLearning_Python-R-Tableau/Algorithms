Dynamic programming:

Tabulation : Bottom up Dynamic programming: Solve all sub problem to arrive at the solution for the bigger problem
Memoization: Top Down Dynamic programming: (Recursion with memory): Solve From top down and solve only those sub problems that needs to be solved

Problems where all the sub problems are not needed to be solved memoization dynamic programming performs better.
